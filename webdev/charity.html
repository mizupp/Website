Helping out at different occasions has provided me with more connections to whom I can reach out to when I also need help.  One of the biggest benefits of these small contributions is the time spent with other people; each person has their own life, own story and they all want someone to hear it.</p>

						<h3>Gurdwara visits</h3>

						<p>I have had the luxury of visiting many gurdwaras in my lifetime; from a young age, my mother wanted to me to get to know as many different religions as possible and with majority of her friends being Sikh, it was more of an obligation. Recently, I visited two gurdwaras through my own decision; the whole experience was a blessing; everyone was extremely friendly and I even got to have a chat with the women who help out there whilst the other women cooked. The purpose of the visit was to make connections with the gurdwara with my local mosque to make it accessible for everyone to attend exciting events at either location..</p>

At the top when we click on the "span link" (which is the navbar), it activates this script. The script then tries to find where the "myNav" id is being used. It applies the styles of classes with the div of this id, 100% fully across the page.
	
document.getElementById("myNav").style.width = "0%";

When the navbar is open, we need to close it as well; there is a little cross at the top of the page. When you click it, it brings the style to 0% width therefore we no longer see it on the page.

At the top we have put what style sheet we want when we click on the button. This code gets the stylesheet for us so that it can be applied. For the example given, on clicking this link, we would be using the function "lightDarkSheet" to get the stylesheet that we want.

We getting the elements that have the class of "mySlides" within the html code and then making it into our variable of "slides". The "dots" are the little preview image thumbnail buttons at the bottom of the slideshow.

The original code had "captionTexts" as well which were supposed to be at the bottom of the slideshow; these were also linked the "alt" of the images however I got rid of that since I didn't need it for my code. Instead I made my own caption divs and put those onto the slideshow rather than having them under the slideshow.

  if (n < 1) {slideIndex = slides.length}
  for (i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {

This code is to make sure that the images show up in the slideshow since without it, the images would appear enlarged underneath the slideshow container.

for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) {
  dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(" active", "");
}
There is a for loop which iterates through the length of dots; this is to make sure that after the little thumbnails have been clicked, they return back to their style from their class.



The slides style is blocked when slidesIndex is no longer one and if that is the case then the dots become "active"; allowing the event to be triggered; so now we will be able to see the images.
