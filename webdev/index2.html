									<p>Hi there! You should probably know a bit more about me before you dive into my website. My name is Mizna Uppal, I have many hobbies however one that stands out to me the most is “drawing”. Making this website really let me explore my creative side and I spent a considerable amount of time completing an art portfolio just for this project, so please check that out on my art page. 
If this website appears to be too bright for your eyes, feel free to hover over my name and switch the page to darkmode; this option is on every page, except the art page. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website! </p>

<!--Notice we have not started a new container yet. This is because I wanted more typography effects in the same container. These are added through use of the class container2, it makes the colour of text transparent and gives it a text-shadow, thus a blur text effect. The below text is just extracts from some books, it is not important to read and only serves purpose of design.  -->
				<div class = "container2">
<!--indexparatext -->
					<p>“We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our desires—we believe it because otherwise we can see no favourable outcome. We do not think of the outcome which generally comes to pass and is also favourable: we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our desires, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it, and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.”</p>

					<p>“The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.”</p>

					<p>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”</p>
					<p>“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn’t something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn’t get in, and walk through it, step by step. There’s no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That’s the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.
And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You’ll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.
And once the storm is over you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.”</p>

At the top when we click on the "span link" (which is the navbar), it activates this script. The script then tries to find where the "myNav" id is being used. It applies the styles of classes with the div of this id, 100% fully across the page.

When the navbar is open, we need to close it as well; there is a little cross at the top of the page. When you click it, it brings the style to 0% width therefore we no longer see it on the page.
