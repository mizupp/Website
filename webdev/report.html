		<h3> Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement.</h3>
		<p>The website entails my personal experiences, art and charity work. There is a clear navigation bar at the top that opens a full page navigation bar. Some pages have an extra navigation that link to other parts on the page. There is a clear tree structure. </p>
		</div>
		
			
		<div class ="report1">	
		<h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. </h3>
		<p>-	The graphics on my website were inspired by several artists; however modern everyday artists such as “kiwipok”, “yuumei” and “kuvshinov-ilya” have influenced my graphics work and art portfolio I made for this website.  </p>
		<p> -	A developer who inspired the art of typography was “Jenny Johannesson” [6]; her award winning website allowed me to carry on my research with current trends that are being applied to websites and how I can utilise them for my own. She was also the one who inspired me to consider a Splash Page for my website.</p>
		<p> -	A website which really aided my work was “codrops” [7]; there were so many inspiring articles and new ways to use css3 and js that I wouldn’t have been able to discover myself. I was able to experiment separately using the articles and then see if I could use it on my own website; codrops allowed me to be more creative and original.</p>

		<h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>
		<p>To make my website more accessible, I have used big fonts, especially when the screen is at full width. The colours of the text that are important and supposed to be read are in black; which is a basic, easy to read font colour.  </p>
		<p>To make my website easier for the eyes (since I have used vibrant colours): I have created 2 buttons which can be previewed when you hover over “MIZNA UPPAL”. This allows the user to have a “dark style” and a “light style”. I mention this in my “Welcome” section on the page that appears after my splash page. </p>

		<p> The website is responsive and work on different devices. This has been tested on my own devices and using the Google chrome’s developer tools “toggle device toolbar” function.</p>
		</div>
					
		<div class ="report1">	
		<h3> State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site. </h3>
		<p>There is a clear navigation menu at the top of every single page; it is a fixed navigation that scrolls with the user; it has a clear white background so that is it easy to see. Upon clicking, it opens up a full page navigation bar; this changes font size and is responsive. This makes the website easy to navigate around. </p>
		<p>I sent a link to the website to several people to see if were able to preview the website and if it was working for them. This allowed me to receive positive feedback since they were able to navigate through the website with ease. </p>

		<p>I have limited myself to the number of fonts that are being used and there is a repeated pattern of the fonts applied. For typography and bold text, I always used either “Black-butler” or “Black-butler-stencil”. For reading texts, I used “Chivo-Regular” or “Chivo-Bold”. This makes it easier to user to understand where the header is and where the paragraphs are. </p>
		<p> The target audience for the website is mainly people who are interested in art (or reading about me). This generally goes towards young adult audience rather than an older generation however the website is still easy to use and navigate around even for such users since the navigation bar is at the top, it is easy to memorise your way around the website with a consistent colour scheme on each page. You can visit any page and it will be clear that you are still on my website.</p>
		</div>
					
		<div class ="report1">	
		<h3> State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site). </h3>
		<p> I was very interested in making a dark theme and light theme for my website and spent a considerable amount of time trying to work out how I could make a similar effect. I learnt about “greyscale filters” after extensive research. My initial plan was to implement a JS code that would be applied to a button onclick; this code would be able to access my main stylesheet and find my “html” styling; it would then change the html style and add a greyscale filter. It sounds great in theory however in practice it was a little more than complicated considering I only knew one way to apply a greyscale filter. Later, I found a code which allows the style sheet to change with the click of the button; however the problem with this code was that you cannot alternate back to the old stylesheet. The code was only for a single button so I adjusted it for two buttons and therefore the user would be able to alternate between the two stylesheets. Before doing this, I was trying to find how I could create a single “toggle” button which would be able to alternate between two different stylesheets. This would have been applied to a single button/ link at the top rather than the drop down menu I have at the moment when you hover over my name. The only one page I didn’t apply this dark and light filter to was my “art page” and that is because I want my artwork to be previewed in colour rather than black and white. [23 bundle]</p>
		<p> I had to teach myself how to use CSS animations to make a richer and attractive website. This included CSS transitions[28], CSS keyframe animations[29] and 2D/3D transformations[30]. W3Schools made this a lot easier since all the information is complied on their website. </p>

		<p> In the past when I have tried to make basic websites, I always ended up using Google fonts since it is really easy to import the fonts onto the website and apply the fonts to your own. Making this website gave me the opportunity to learn how to use web fonts [31] and free websites I could use to convert free font files into web fonts [32] that can be used on my website through @font-face. </p>

		<p> </p>
		</div>

		<div class ="report1">	
		<h3> What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? </h3>
		<h4> SUMMARY OF LIST OF THINGS THAT WORKED WELL:</h4>
		<p> -	Splash page: one big main page that shows one of my artworks made just for this website, it almost sets the mood as the person enters the website and reflects me as a person since this is my website.<br>
		-	Light and dark theme: I think having a greyscale filter to make the website easy for the eyes worked well since it made my website more accessible to a larger audience.<br>
		-	Full page navigation bar: the navigation bar menu is always there on every page and because it is so small, it doesn’t over complicate my website and allows the user to preview everything on the page with ease.<br>
		-	Colour scheme: the colour scheme of pink and black worked really well, it is not too harsh on the eyes, the text is still easy to read but I am using bold colours (which is a current trend).<br>
		-	Typography: this trend is being applied to many websites and was found on many award winning websites such as Jenny’s. I tried to use a similar serif font to create a visually appealing website.<br>
		-	Animation: the animation on my website is minimal but effective. The website can still be used even if the javascript is turned on. I was able to utlise js on my website through codepen examples and stackoverflow. <br>
		-	Other links: those links individual to the page all work and are found in the header part of the website. On charity page, upon clicking the chapters links at the top, the website smooth scrolls to the correct section instead of abruptly moving to the section.<br>
		-	Simple footer: I kept the footer simple since I didn’t want it to take the attention from website design.<br>
		</p>
		
		<h4>PERSONAL</h4>
		<p>  I have managed to create an <b>original</b> website that reflects me as a person. This was my biggest worry when I started to create my website. I made two other website prior to this one; the ones I made before were clear and simple, they used dull and neutral colours however they didn’t match my artwork portfolio. I felt that there was no fluidity to my websites since my drawing style is quite sketchy and light, it didn’t match with the heaviness of dark backgrounds and thin texts. Trying to make a website can be quite stressful since there is a sense of competition within designers; most of the award winning websites had a very similar layout:<br>

		<p>-	A transparent header at the top which becomes fixed and a navigation bar background appears (or smoothly transitions)<br>
		-	Background that covers the entire page or a slideshow that covers the entire page<br>
		-	“Slide down” buttons<br></p>

		<p>There were so many things I could take away from such websites and all I was doing was trying to apply similar effects onto mine - it was leading to a recipe for disaster. I decided to follow my own design instincts and to go with my original plan which was to put my artwork in the spotlight. Instead of taking inspirations from websites alone, I decided to take a break and find develop my own ideas through artists and magazines; this allowed me to create a colour scheme, know what fonts to use for my typography, implement new graphic techniques. Thus, I was able to utilise my artwork for my website and create an original design which you cannot find on other websites.</p>

		<div class ="report1">	
		<h3> What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time? What resources were used when creating your work?</h3>
			<h4>THINGS THAT CAN BE IMPROVED:</h4>
		<p> -	Improve my charity page, perhaps adding a grid gallery at the bottom of the page which has images of loads of my charity work. This is more interesting to look at rather than having the same slideshow container that I have used on my art page. Grid images would have made it more interesting. <br>
-	Including older art projects within my art page to show constant improvement, somewhat like a timeline design from my new projects all the way down to my old art pieces.  <br>
-	A smooth slide down transition of my drop down menu for light and dark instead of a choppy drop down. <br>
-	Instead of using a CSS animation for my typewriter, I should have used a plug-in such as “charming” (free on github); this is more simple and attractive. <br>
-	Ink stains code could have been improved if there was a way of adding texture to the background of the dots along with the colour; I tried to experiment with this and will keep on doing so until I find a way. <br>
-	On my art page, it would have been more aesthetically pleasing for the slideshow to have a fade effect as you navigate the images. <br>
-	A footer that pops up slightly and smoothly when you reach the bottom of the page instead of a standard footer.  <br>
-	A plug-in or js library that loads all my images before you open the page. My art pictures load up quite slowly on my art page; it would be better for them to load up beforehand. <br>
-	On my chapters page, have each white card (the container divs) to slide in as you scroll down and instead of sliding in from the side; find a better way for them to slide up on scroll; this could be achieved through a jquery plug-in. <br>
</p>
			
			<h4> Things I would do differently:</h4>
			<p>-	 Instead of using CSS to make website responsive, I should have used a plug-in or even bootstrap to ensure that my website is 100% responsive without me having to write much code. <br>
-	Use some SCCS since there are so many more things you can do with it especially typography. Using just CSS3 was limiting since I had to rely solely on text shadow and good fonts.<br>
-	Masking techniques using CSS3 to hide and show things on scroll; makes the website more interesting; this is shown by Sara Soueidan [24] on her blog and her article on alistapart [25].<br>
-	Use SVG to create shapes, animations to make it more visually appealing as demonstrated in this morphing transition demo on codrops [26].
-	Using JS libraries such as modernizr [27] since it would allow me to take advantage of new features in the browsers and can still control the website if the browsers cannot.<br>

		<h2> RESOURCES USED TO MAKE WEBSITE</h2>
		<h3>Splash page:</h3>
		<p><b>Ink stains on hover</b><br>
		For animation of little ink stains that appear when you hover around the page, I found the inspiration through Onextrapixels [1]. I used ideas from these two codepen [2] [3] mouseover examples; and used one of the codes after some changes for my “ink stain dot effect”.<br>
	
		<i> <br>
		    ALL CHANGES MADE CAN BE SEEN WHEREEVER THE CODE IS BEING APPLIED IN COMMENTS.</i><br></p>

		<p><b>Typewriter effect</b><br>
		Before I was going to use js to implement the typewriter effect however this was possible using css as well. I used a codepen example [5] that was found on the “css-tricks” website [4].<br>

		<i> <br>
		    ALL CHANGES MADE CAN BE SEEN WHEREEVER THE CODE IS BEING APPLIED IN COMMENTS.
</i><br></p>
		
			
	    <h3>HOMEPAGE:</h3>
       <p><b>Light and dark JS</b><br>
		For the light and dark effect [8], I used different stack overflow examples and simplified it to make a stylesheet changing code for two buttons [9]. <br>
	
		<i> <br>
		    ALL CHANGES MADE CAN BE SEEN WHEREEVER THE CODE IS BEING APPLIED IN COMMENTS.</i><br></p>
		
			
			
		<h3>Art Page:</h3>
		<p><b>Slideshow</b><br>
		Slideshow container basic structure was taken from W3schools [10]; the original slideshow had 6 slides however I adjusted that to 4 slides. There was a separate div that placed the caption at the bottom of the slideshow however I wanted the captions to be on the slideshow container so I adjusted that and placed captions onto the slideshow on the container. I also changed the background of the container to make it light pink and since the images have a light opacity, it complimented well and the images were given a pink tint. I added hover over opacity transition effects to the little preview images at the bottom of the slideshow. <br>
	

		<p><b>Hover over effects</b><br>
		For the grid, I used ideas from the codrops “circle hover effects with css transitions” [11]. I adjusted the css to make a grid- like layout that would contain my images. I adjusted my code so that my rectangle images being hovered over have similar css transitions as the ones shown in the codrops article. <br>
			
		<h3>Chapters</h3>
		<p><b>Capital letter</b><br>
		For my chapter’s page, I got the idea of having the first letter as bigger than others from “css-tricks” [20]. Later, I decided to do with the old school method and giving each first letter a separate class since that way I could choose what I want capitalised and bigger. <br>
	

		<p><b>Slide in effect</b><br>
		Animation slide in using css when you open chapters page. This was created after experimenting with css animation/ keyframes. At first I was trying to see how codepen examples such one by Simon Cordington [33] worked and how the css transition was working. It was slightly overdone and didn’t match well with the theme of my website therefore I decided to opt in making my own code for simpler css transitions. I used websites such as thoughtbot [34] and codepen examples.<br>


			
		<h3>General</h3>
		<p><b>Menus</b><br>
		For the full page navigation menu I used W3schools along with the drop down menu [12] for “light and dark”<br>
	
		<i> <br>
		    ALL CHANGES MADE CAN BE SEEN WHEREEVER THE CODE IS BEING APPLIED IN COMMENTS.</i><br>
			
			I made a lot of adjusted to the code; changing width, paddings, where and how it is placed. Using this code enabled me to understand the simple structure of a dropdown button which I was able to utilise for my own. I added images of bulbs which I had made to complete the art website look I was trying to achieve. The full changes are obvious on preview and through css of the code on my stylesheet.css.<br></p>

		<p><b>Web fonts/Typography</b><br>
			Web fonts for both text and typography, I used “Butler” [13] and “Chivo” [14]. These were found on creativebloq [15] </p>
			
		<p><b>Artwork</b><br>
			All artwork that is found on the website is my own and drawn by me. For larger resolutions and preview of main artwork, they can be found on this website [16].</p>
		
		
			<p><b>Design tips</b><br>
			For design tips, I used the “designspace” [17]; it had beneficial articles that suited the task of this project and gave me inspiration and a motivation boost. <br>
			I loved the fonts that the Vogue website [18] was using and wanted to apply similar serif ones to my own website. <br>
			This award winning website (luchohler) [19] has a little icon navigation bar; this is what inspired me to do something similar. I loved how the entire website was centered in the middle; there was use of bright oranges, yellows and reds which worked well with black text and white background. I decided to go for a similar look.<br>
			</p>
		</div>
			
			
		
			<div class ="report1">	
			<h3> Smooth scrolling</h3>
			<p> The idea was taken from a codepen [21] example, the user was using smooth scrolling and I decided I wanted to use it too: <br>
			I used the jquery code from w3schools [22].<br>
			I changed the code slightly and adjusted the time it takes to scroll when you click on the links. I adjusted it to make the smooth scrolling slightly slower since I wanted a smoother scroll. The code is very simple since all it does it detect where the hash (ids) are being used and direct the window to the id.<br>
			</p>
			</div>

			
			<div class ="report1">	
			<h3> Libaries</h3>
			<p> Used Jquery for “pagefade” animation when you open each page (except the chapters page).
			https://jquery.com/download/
			I changed the code to make the fading a little faster since I don’t want the users to be waiting too long for the page to load. <br>
