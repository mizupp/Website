		<p>If you were to ask me this question now, I’d have no clue. However, the 4 year old Mizna shot a fast reply of “I want to be a teacher”. My mother laughed and told me to become a doctor, just like any other Asian parent.</p>
		
		<p>On a serious note though, why did I want to become a teacher? Habits never die and I have a habit of wanting to help people. They might not ask for my help, but I’ll help them regardless. This leads me to talk about my who biggest inspiration was when I was younger. My aunt, who is also a teacher was my biggest inspiration as a child. She is the one who instilled a passion for literature and arts into my soul and for that I am ever so grateful, even today. </p>

		<p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>alent doesn’t just appear overnight, it comes through with perseverance and dedication. Being devoted for traditional arts at a young age; my arts were mostly creative and not visual. I loved drawing and I loved being admired; nothing is more satisfying than someone looking at your work and giving you a pat on the back. My parents were always impressed with how well I could draw but each compliment would come with a bitter remark of how I should be studying. So like any rebel teenager, I’d practice in secret and try to balance my studies at the same time.
		Out of the 14 GCSE subjects I studied, Art GCSE was not one of them. Despite achieving A*-B in all my GCSEs, there is still a deep regret inside me for not being able to express my artistic skills in a classroom environment where I’d be given feedback.
		Studying at university has given me more time to work on my hobbies without any restrictions. Painting digitally is the most convenient for me considering the variety of art styles you can explore with entirely using a single medium at any location; I do enjoy drawing traditionally just as much.

		<p>Being good at art and graphics designing has allowed me to work with small companies such as Planet Hobbywood; a small American sports shop that needed ideas for designing their new logo. </p>

		<p>Currently, I am working for a local mosque magazine, which publishes over 1200 magazines every 4 months; the project is small and aimed at Muslim women. Since the target audience is small and our funding is little with each household only paying £10 a year, we have to do all the work ourselves; from writing the articles, to designing, publishing and even packaging; distribution is done via curtsey of Royal Mail. I was placed under this position through recommendation since they were in need on specific skill set students and graduates.  </p>

		<p>For the past 2 years, I have been in charge of creating monthly newsletters for my local mosque community. I am handed data and images through various secretaries and my job is to implement a newsletter that contains all this information along with information I am handed down from my department. Being an office bearer has improved my graphic designing and art skills and led me to work with other clients and large scale projects as well. </p>

<p><span class="firstcharacter">E</span>xhibitions – working with tight deadlines</p>

	<p>Through recommendations, I was given the role of main graphics designer for an international exhibition. This exhibition was to be placed at an event where people from all over the word were going to be seeing. I was placed with some heavy responsibilities and tight deadlines since the previous team decided to quit 2 weeks before the setting up. After numerous meetings with several clients and the managers who were organising the events, I was briefed on my tasks; a job which was to be completed by a team of 8 in the time period of a month was now being completed by a single person in just two weeks. The work was exhausting and hectic since whilst in the middle of completing a design, I would get phone calls telling me to change everything. There would be random meetings in the middle of the day which I was obliged to attend; most of my work was being done in the car. After many sleepless nights and survival on cups of coffee, I managed to get all the printing done via a pre-booked appointment at the printing shop and was driven by my manager straight to the venue on the day of set-up.</p>

	<p>The exhibition was a success and I was nominated and won a regional award for my efforts. The same exhibition has been set up many times this year and I’ve had to allocate myself time to setting it up whenever I am asked to do so. This experience really opened my eyes to the importance of time management and how all the work should be in the favour of the client. Through this large scale project, I have been placed with many other opportunities. In the future, I will be working on annual report designing.</p>

<!--I wanted the first character to be different to the rest therefore I added span an gave that a class and styled that class seperately.-->				
	<p><span class="firstcharacter">L</span>eaflet distribution system</p>

	<p>In the past, I have helped my father create a leafleting system. The system was used to split the UK into regions and sectors; this data was then used to implement fastest leaflet delivery times. It was used to fulfil monthly quotas of leaflet delivery. The system was then published online to make it easier for everyone who needs to use it; the only way is access it is through a password which is generated and provided after contact.</p>

NOW, we can use jquery to animate and add a smooth page scroll. This smooth scrolling effect is added to the "html" and body. We use the ".animate" which is a jquery method. We apply "scrollTop" to all the "hash" ids. We also specify a number which is referred to in millisconds; this is how long it will take for us to get to the area that we want.
        
window.location.hash = hash;

Lastly, the "#/ hash" is added to the URL once we have finished scrolling; concluding our if statement.
