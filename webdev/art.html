<!--This script is written in js.

We getting the elements that have the class of "mySlides" within the html code and then making it into our variable of "slides". The "dots" are the little preview image thumbnail buttons at the bottom of the slideshow.

The original code had "captionTexts" as well which were supposed to be at the bottom of the slideshow; these were also linked the "alt" of the images however I got rid of that since I didn't need it for my code. Instead I made my own caption divs and put those onto the slideshow rather than having them under the slideshow.

  if (n > slides.length) {slideIndex = 1}
  if (n < 1) {slideIndex = slides.length}
  for (i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {
      slides[i].style.display = "none";
  }

This code is to make sure that the images show up in the slideshow since without it, the images would appear enlarged underneath the slideshow container.

for (i = 0; i < dots.length; i++) {
  dots[i].className = dots[i].className.replace(" active", "");
}
There is a for loop which iterates through the length of dots; this is to make sure that after the little thumbnails have been clicked, they return back to their style from their class.



The slides style is blocked when slidesIndex is no longer one and if that is the case then the dots become "active"; allowing the event to be triggered; so now we will be able to see the images.

At the top when we click on the "span link" (which is the navbar), it activates this script. The script then tries to find where the "myNav" id is being used. It applies the styles of classes with the div of this id, 100% fully across the page.
	
document.getElementById("myNav").style.width = "0%";

When the navbar is open, we need to close it as well; there is a little cross at the top of the page. When you click it, it brings the style to 0% width therefore we no longer see it on the page.
